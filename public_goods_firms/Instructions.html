        You will participate in {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} periods. In every period you are endowed with
        {{ C.EFFORT_ENDOWMENT }} effort units. You may keep effort for yourself or contribute it to your
        firm. Effort kept for yourself yields one point per unit. Effort contributed to your firm generates
        points for every member of your firm, including you.
    </p>
    <p>
        The session is configured for <strong>{{ player.subsession.formation_type|title }}</strong> firm formation
        and <strong>{{ player.subsession.returns_type }}</strong> returns to scale. In exogenous sessions you are
        assigned to firms automatically. In endogenous sessions you choose which firm to work for each period
        (or you may work alone). Firms may have at most {{ C.MAX_FIRM_SIZE }} members.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under <em>constant</em> returns, the marginal per-capita return (MPCR) depends on the number of members.
        Under <em>increasing</em> returns, the firm production function is calibrated so that full effort matches the
        constant-return MPCR but marginal returns grow with total effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each period has up to 120 seconds for firm formation (endogenous only), 60 seconds to allocate effort,
        and 30 seconds to review outcomes.
